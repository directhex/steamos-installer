- Fixed regression in audio between first and second releases (added steam and desktop users to pulse-access group)
- Modified Pulse config to not force a specific sound card, and to restore card volume on boot
- Shipped a replacement debootstrap, which will not fail at random on users' systems when generating their own image
- Included all non-Free firmware from Debian Wheezy
- Added ntfsprogs-udeb to allow NTFS resizing in the installer (Valve GitHub issue [88](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/issues/88))
- Deleted unneeded 32-bit installer files, freeing about 300MB from the image size
- Include pavucontrol in the installation
